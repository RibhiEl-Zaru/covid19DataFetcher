# covid19DataFetcher

First of all, thank you very much to the api that made this project possible. The URL is right here: https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/covid-193 

Much luv fambam.

Second of all, I'm going to eveeentually tie this up to a website based on React.
Until then, if you want to play around with the data, feel free to change the app.js file as you wish and run the following in the directory with the app.js file.


<pre><code> node app.js
</code></pre>


wowowow so easy, unless you don't have node installed, then install it and run that bad boy.

Anyways hope you have fun playing around with this data! fyi I will probably blindly accept PR's and I can't wait to have the website up and running!
